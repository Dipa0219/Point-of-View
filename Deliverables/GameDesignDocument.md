# Point of view #

## Overview and vision statement ##

“Point of View” is a level-based puzzle game in which two or more small robots must find a way to exit the 
room by activating all the buttons in the room simultaneously. Simple, right? Sure, if it weren’t for a 
malfunction preventing the two robots from changing their view, making everything outside their field of 
vision unknown. Therefore, the only way for them to escape is to rely on each other, and cooperation will be 
the key to their escape

## Gameplay ##

The gameplay is simple yet engaging: the player will simultaneously control two distinct robots. For one, only a first-person view is available, while for the other, the player can control its movements, with the option to swap roles at any time. The objective of the game is to have the two robots collaborate to reach the end of the level, marked by the simultaneous pressing of two buttons.

To move the robots, players can use either the arrow keys or the WASD keys, while the C key allows them to switch between robots. As the levels progress, new mechanics are introduced, such as movable boxes and intermediate buttons to press, gradually increasing the game’s difficulty and making the experience progressively more challenging and engaging.

## Characters ##

We have only two distinct characters in our game, that are the due robot that you control during the gameplay. 
There's the possibility to add a third evil character only in case we have time to add a little backstory between the different levels

## Story ##

For the moment there isn't any story in our game.
We have discussed some possibilities to eventually add in a second time only if there's enough time:
- One evil robot that makes a joke to the main characters and that's the reason why they are blocked and they have to press the buttons to free themselves. In the last level we make a sort of boss fight in which by completing the puzzles you reduce the life of the evil bot.
- An hacker attacked the laboratory where the robot are and they have to escape that place in order to reach a engineer that can adjust their problem. The button are used to access the following rooms. 

## World ##

The game is set in a laboratory warehouse divided into different zones that the robots must navigate to reach their objectives. We’ve designed the game to include three distinct worlds, each introducing a new core mechanic:

World 1: A tutorial world where players learn the basics of the game, understanding how to make the robots work together to achieve their goal.

World 2: A world that introduces new elements, including buttons that alter the environment and boxes that assist the player. These boxes can be used to reach different areas or to hold down buttons that need to stay pressed.

World 3: The final world introduces moving platforms that add new challenges. These platforms can transport the player (even while in the robot’s first-person view, as the platform moves beneath them) and can rotate the robot, which is otherwise impossible.

Each world progressively builds on the collaboration mechanics, making the gameplay increasingly complex and engaging.
