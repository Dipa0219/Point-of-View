# Point of view #
“Point of View” is a level-based puzzle game in which two or more small robots must find a way to exit the 
room by activating all the buttons in the room simultaneously. Simple, right? Sure, if it weren’t for a 
malfunction preventing the two robots from changing their view, making everything outside their field of 
vision unknown. Therefore, the only way for them to escape is to rely on each other, and cooperation will be 
the key to their escape
